            A rock is a solid mass of geological materials.
            Geological materials include individual mineral crystals,
            inorganic non-mineral solids like glass, pieces broken from other rocks, 
            and even fossils. The geological materials in rocks may be inorganic, 
            but they can also include organic materials such as the partially decomposed 
            plant matter preserved in coal. A rock can be composed of only 
            one type of geological material or mineral, but many are composed of several types.

        <h2>Types of Rocks</h2>
        <p>
            Rocks are grouped into three main categories based on how they form.
            These are sedimentary, metamorphic and ingeous.
